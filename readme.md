Thoughts
===
I'm going to pass a configuration collection into the constructor. I'm guessing that our customer isn't going to want to change the numbers to replace with every call of this function. 

I'm also going to assume that our previous customers will want to continue to be able to use the default FizzBuzz behavior. 

I don't know what to name this method. It needs to be a verb, but I honestly don't know what it is doing. So, I'm just going to name it "Fizzle" which is... not great. 

I'm ignoring the need for a upper bound since our user can just use the library lazily.
